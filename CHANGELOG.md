# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [unreleased]

## [0.8.1] - 2025-04-28

- Fix docs.rs build

## [0.8.0] - 2025-04-27

- Add support for bevy v0.16

## [0.7.0] - 2024-12-09

- Add support for bevy v0.15

## [0.6.0] - 2024-12-08

- Add `action::trigger` and `action::trigger_targets` convenience systems.
- Bump keyseq to 0.4.0, which changes notation to be more standard: `Ctrl-A`
  instead of `ctrl-A`.

## [0.5.0] - 2024-06-05

### Features
- Optimize look ups to incrementally search using O(log n) instead of O(m^2 log n). See [PR #7](https://github.com/not-elm/bevy-input-sequence/pull/7) for more details.

### Bugs
- Fix bug where "W A S D" and "A S" sequences would match the latter pattern when "W A S P" was typed.

## [0.4.0] - 2024-04-23

### Features

- Generalize to running one-shot systems instead of firing events.
- Use plugin.
- Can configure schedule and system set.
- Remove `GamepadEvent`; use system with input `In<Gamepad>`.
- Add `IntoCondSystem` that adds `only_if()` conditi:ons to `IntoSystems`.
- Add `only_if` example.
- Add `prelude` module for glob imports.

### Refactor

- Hollow out lib so it's just `mod` and `pub use` statements.
- Extract sets of functionality from `lib.rs` into `chord.rs`, `cache.rs` and `plugin.rs`.
- Extract tests into `tests/simulated.rs`.

## [0.3.0] - 2024-03-08

### Features

- Removed `Act::Any`, so we can no longer define an act composed of multiple buttons(or keycodes).
- The keyboard and gamepad now use different sequences.


## [0.2.0] - 2024-02-24

### Features

- Add support for bevy v0.12
- Add key chord support
- Add `key!` and `keyseq!` macro from `keyseq` crate.
- Make controllers' sequences independent of one another.
- Add `add_input_sequence_run_if()` variant.
- Add "keymod" example that uses key chords.
- Add "run_if" example

### Refactor

- Make timeout setting more ergonomic.
- Use a trie for sequence detection.

  Changes the algorithmic complexity each tick from `O(number of key_sequences)`
  to `O(length of longest key sequence)`.

- Make `new()` generic: `new<T:Into<Act>>(inputs: [T])`

### Documentation

- Describe examples in README
- Add installation, usage, and license sections to README

### Test

- The `multiple_inputs` test is disabled.

  This test includes keyboard and controller inputs. It's not clear how to
  manage these with controller sequences being independent from one another.

## [0.1.0] - 2023-08-19

- 一通りの機能の実装
